Description:  Given a time series in R^n with a piece-wise constant mean and independent noises, we propose an exact dynamic programming algorithm to minimize a least square criterion with a multiscale penalty promoting well-spread changepoints. Such a penalty has been proposed in Verzelen et al. (2020), and it achieves optimal rates for changepoint detection and changepoint localization (arXiv:2010.11470). Our proposed algorithm, named Ms.Fpop, extends functional pruning ideas of Rigaill 2015 and Maidstone et al. 2017 to multiscale penalties. For large signals, n >= 10^5, with relatively few real changepoints, Ms.Fpop is typically quasi-linear and an order of magnitude faster than PELT. We propose an efficient C++ implementation interfaced with R of Ms.Fpop allowing to segment a profile of up to n = 10^6 in a matter of seconds.
